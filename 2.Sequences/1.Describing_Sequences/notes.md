### Closed formula
A closed formula for a sequence $(a_n)_{n\in\N}$ is a formula for $a_n$
 using a fixed finite number of operations on $n$.
 This is what you normally think of as a formula in $n$,
 just as if you were defining a function in terms of $n$ 
 (because that is exactly what you are doing). 
 > Normal formulaic sequence(you only need the formula to find values)
### Recursive Definition
A recursive definition (sometimes called an inductive definition) for a sequence $(a_n)_{n\in\N}$ consists of a recurrence relation : an equation relating a term of the sequence to previous terms (terms with smaller index) and an initial condition: a list of a few terms of the sequence (one less than the number of terms in the recurrence relation).
> Recursive sequence values are calculated by defining a relation ship with previous values of the sequence.

### Common Sequences
$1, 4, 9, 16, 25$ The "<strong>Square Numbers</strong>" the sequence $(S_n)_{n {\geq} 1} $ has a closed formula $S_n = n^2$


$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21$ The <strong>Triangular Numbers</strong>. The sequence $(S_n)_{n {\geq} 1}$ has closed formula $S_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

$1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32$ The <strong>Powers of Two</strong>. The sequence $(a_n)_{n {\geq} 0}$ has closed formula $a_n = 2^n$.

$1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13$ The <strong>Fibbunacci Numbers(or Fibonacci sequence)</strong>. Defined recursively by $F_n = F_{n - 1} + F_{n + 2}$ with $F_1 = F_2 = 1$

$1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040$ The <strong>Factorial Sequence</strong>. Defined recursively by $Fa_n = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*(1)$

### Partial Sums
Definition sum of terms of the sequence example $1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...$ has a sequence of partial sums of $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36$
