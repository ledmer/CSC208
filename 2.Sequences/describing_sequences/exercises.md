 
### 1. Find the closed formula for each of the following sequences by relating them to a well known sequence. Assume the first term given is $a_1$.

a. $2, 5, 10, 17, 26,...$
> $d_1 = 3, d_2 = 5, d_3 = 7, d_4 = 9$
<br>
>Second difference $= d_{2nd}$
<br>
>$d_{2nd} = d_i - d_{i-1}$
<br>
>$d_{2nd} = 9 - 7$
<br>
>$d_{2nd} = 2$

b. $0, 2, 5, 8, 14, 20,...$

c. $8, 12, 17, 23, 30,...$

d. $1, 5, 23, 119, 719,...$
